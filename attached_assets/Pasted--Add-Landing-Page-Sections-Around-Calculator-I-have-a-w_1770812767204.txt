# Add Landing Page Sections Around Calculator

I have a working rent-vs-buy calculator that pulls from a config file. I want to turn this into a full landing page by adding sections before and after the calculator.

Keep the existing calculator exactly as it is. Add these sections around it.

---

## SECTIONS TO ADD (in order)

### 1. Hero (top of page)
- Headline: "The Rent Vs Buy Calculator for {projectName}"
- Subheadline: "We Can Launch It In 15 Mins"
- Embedded YouTube video (URL from config)
- Alert box below video: "Don't Skip The Video Above - I built something specifically for you. This isn't a template. It's ready to deploy."

### 2. What I Made
Three items showing what's included:
- Custom Lead Magnet
- Walkthrough Video  
- 15-Min Setup Call

### 3. Why This Will Work
Text section explaining the problem with generic forms and unqualified leads. Personalize with {projectName}. This is the "pain" section before showing the solution.

### 4. Credibility (before calculator)
- Stats bar: 1,000+ Projects | $500M+ Property Value | 15 Developer Clients
- Case study box for Furthmann Massivhaus (€7M+ sales, 20+ units, under 12 months)

### 5. THE CALCULATOR (already built - keep as is)

### 6. How It Works
Four numbered steps explaining what happens when a buyer uses the calculator (they engage, spend 10 mins, self-qualify, then submit details)

### 7. Book A Call CTA
- Headline: "Everything Is Built. We Just Need 15 Minutes To Launch."
- Calendly embed (hardcoded URL)

### 8. FAQ
Accordion or simple list with 6 questions about the free offer, what happens on the call, timeline, etc.

### 9. About Me
Photo + bio for Tulsa Mann, Founder of The Property Look. Include the main offer headline and social links. (All hardcoded - same for every prospect)

### 10. Final CTA
Simple closing section with Calendly link

## CONFIG ADDITION NEEDED

Add to the existing config:

```typescript
walkthroughVideoUrl: "https://youtube.com/embed/XXXXX",
```

Everything else (Calendly, socials, bio, FAQ content, credibility stats) is hardcoded - same for all prospects.

## NOTES

- Use the same design language as the existing calculator
- Only {developerName}, {projectName}, {location}, and {walkthroughVideoUrl} change per prospect
- Keep it clean and professional
- Mobile responsive
